# Overview {-}

This notebook contains the accompanying code to the exam project for the course *Introduction to Cultural Data Science* in the autumn of 2021 at the University of Aarhus. This notebook only contains code. Please see the report for the full project. 

## Software {-}
The code in this notebook is written in **R** and **Python**. I used **Rstudio** and **Jupyter Notebook** as IDE's. A lot of packages are used throughout the book. The references to the packages can be found in \@ref(rference)

## Structure {-}
The structure of the notebook is as follows.

* In step 1 I acquire the data needed and tidy so it is ready for analysis. 
* In step 2 I make Named Entity Recognition (NER) and plot.
* In step 3 i make a sentiment analysis and plot.
* In step 4 i make a LDA topic model and plot.

## How to read the notebook {-}
I have made 4 different highlight colors that i use throughout the book to indicate different things. These colors appear at the beginning of the chapter.

<style>
div.green { background-color:#93c47d; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "green">
A green color indicates that the chapter (or part of it) was written in Python. 
</div>

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">
A blue color indicates that the code in the chapter is run on multiple datasets, but that the code only shows the pipeline of a single dataset. To run the code on the other dataset, minor changes are needed such as changing paths. 
</div>

<style>
div.yellow { background-color:#ffd966; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "yellow">
A yellow color indicates that the chapter is very similar to another chapter with only minor adjustments. 
</div>

<style>
div.red { background-color:#e06666; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "red">
A red color indicates something that the reader should be extra attentive to. 
</div>
