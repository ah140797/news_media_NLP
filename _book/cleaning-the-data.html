<p>Now lets inspect the cleaned dataframe. to see if it looks allright. To do this we use the function <code>datatable</code> from the package <code>DT</code>. The cleaned dataset contains the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>headline</code> which is the title/headline of the article</li>
<li><code>url</code> which is a url leading to the the article on the NYT webpage</li>
<li><code>date</code> which is the publication date</li>
